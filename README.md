# Folder_Organizer-photo-

This project provides a simple solution for organzing your photo collection. This project is made for myself and my friend who are interested in photography and would love to keep our folders organized. It automatically move your images into a structured folder based on the dates and renames with a descriptive tags generated using a AI model (CLIP).


## Main Features

- Date-Based Organization: Photos are moved into Year/Month-Name folders (e.g., 2025/)
- AI-Generated Descriptive Tags: Images are automatically tagged using the CLIP AI model, and these descriptive tags are incorporated into the filename for easy searching and identification.
- RAW File Support
